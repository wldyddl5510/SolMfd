# SolMfd: Algorithms for a solution manifold

## Introduction

Solution manifold is a mathematical concept that can be applied to
various statistical applications, such as constrainted likelihood
optimization. This package implemented functions that find solution
manifolds, solving constrainted likelihood problems in solution
manifold, and fitting prior distribution in solution manifold.
