Description: Solution manifold can generalize various statistical methodologies. 
    This package aims to implement algorithms regarding a solution manifold. 
    This includes finding a solution manifold, as well as statistical applications of solution manifolds.
    To be specific, this package consists of sampling from solution manifold, assigning density to solution manifold, and solving constraint likelihood problem which utilizes solution manifold algorithms.
