Description: Solution manifold can generalize various statistical methodologies. 
    This package aims to implement algorithms regarding a solution manifold. 
    This includes finding a point cloud on the solution manifold, as well as statistical applications of solution manifolds.
    To be specific, this package consists of sampling from solution manifold, assigning posterior density to solution manifold, and solving constraint likelihood problem which utilizes solution manifold algorithms.
    In a later version, additional statistical applications of solution manifold, such as integral estimation and density ridge, can be implemented.
